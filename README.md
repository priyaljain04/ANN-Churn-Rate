# ANN-Churn-Rate
We have a dataset of a bank which operates in Europe and three countries France, Spain, and Germany and the bank has seen unusal churn rate i.e. they've seen customers leaving at unusually high rates and they want to understand what the problem is and they want to assess and address that problem.

Bank provided the six months ago data for the sample of 10 thousand customers with the mentioned fields custom ID, surname, credit score, geography, agenda, age, tenure, how long they've been with the bank,the balance of the customers at that point in time,the number of products they had at that point in time,do they have a savings account, do they have a credit card, do they have a loan, did the customer have a credit card or not,is the customer an active member and estimated salary.
So six months ago they measured all of these things and six months down the track we're going to check who of those customers left and who of those customers stayed and that's what this column Exited represents. It tells you whether or not the person left the bank within those six months.So if it's one that means
the person's no longer with the bank and zero the person's still with the bank.

My goal was to create a demographic centric model to tell the bank which of the customers are at highest risk of leaving.
